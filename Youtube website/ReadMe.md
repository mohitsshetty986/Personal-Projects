**Youtube Video Downloader**

We have implemented a youtube video downloader with a mp4 to mp3 conversion feature using python Flask framework.

Note this is for educational purposes only, using pytube python library ( https://pypi.org/project/pytube/ ) for downloading youtube videos and Flask framework to serve as an interface for the project.

For working of this project please refer the working document available in this repository.
