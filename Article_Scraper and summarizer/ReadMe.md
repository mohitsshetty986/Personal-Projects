**Scraped News Articles from "The Washington Post" website using NLTK python library.**

**1)We can scrape around 120 articles or more using BeautifulSoup library.**

**2) With a tokenizer element named "punkt", we will use "newspaper3k" to automatically extract structured information such as title, author, published date, text passage of article and a short summary of the article using the article URL collected from The Washington Post website using BeautifulSoup lirbrary.**

**3) Found a new english word? I have added a dictionary element to help us while reading the article.**

**4) Want someone to narrate you a long news article? I have added a Google Text to Speech element.**

**5) I have also added an sentiment analysis that determines the emotion of the article i.e. if the topic is 'Sad','Happy','fearful', etc.**
